### chirp.mean

This is my own step-by-step implementation of the Chirp app.

#### notes on Module-2:
express installation (local) needed: `npm install express --save`

command to start: `node app.js`


#### notes on Module-3:
typos in both *README* and *Finished*, causing the particular post API not working (no errors, just `undefined`):
`req.param.id` - must be `req.params.id`
